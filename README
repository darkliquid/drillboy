A clone of Mr. Driller as a way of:

 * practicing my C++
 * practicing games programming
 * learning ClanLib 2

I'll start off focusing on just the game engine, then I'll look into
stuff like intro screens, attract modes, options menus, etc.

Aiming to make this cross-platform, but who knows how it will turn out.
